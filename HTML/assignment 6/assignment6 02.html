    <p>Dear Peter</p>
    <p><b>Re: Sales Assistant Vacancy (vacancy number 40568)</b></p>
    <p>I am writing to apply for the position of Sales Assistant at ABC Clothing Ltd, which was advertised on <br>
        a Trade Me on 14 February 2013.
    </p>
    <p>I have enclosed my CV to support my application. It shows that I would bring important skills to the <br>
        position, including:
    </p>
    <p> <ul><li> time management and strong organisational skills</li>
        <br>
        <li> high-level customer service and friendly relationship management</li>
         <br>
       <li>cash handling and sales ability</li> <br>
        <li>motivation and dedication</li> 
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        As a Sales Assistant at a busy shoe store, I have been able to build up a strong foundation of <br>
        customer service skills.Though I have really enjoyed this role, I am looking for a new challenge in my <br>
        career.
        The Sales Assistant role with ABC Clothing Ltd would offer me a chance to grow and further <br>
        develop my retail <br>career.
    </p>
    <p>
        I would enjoy having the opportunity to talk with you more about this position, and how I could use <br>
        my skills to benefit your organisation at an interview.
    </p>
    <p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
    <p>Yours sincerely</p>
    <p>Lizzie Long</p>
