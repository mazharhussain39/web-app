    <body><h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
            <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other<br>
scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <i>On The Road</i>. It had been Molly's favorited book since college, and the longer she<br>
spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
                <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have<br>
nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <b><abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid
">DNA,</b> to be an outstanding achievement, Molly<br>
<em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p></body>
